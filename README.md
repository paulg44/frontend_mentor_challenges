# frontend_mentor_challenges

Exactly what it says on the tin. I will be completing the frontend mentor challenges as and when. More for a little bit of fun, using many different frameworks such as React, vanilla JS and CSS, Tailwind to name a few. This is a fun repository for when I have a little bit of free time but don't want to work on one of my bigger projects.
